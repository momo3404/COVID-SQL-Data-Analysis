# COVID SQL Data Analysis

I developed this project because, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I felt routinely overwhelmed by the number of statistics and data that was being shared across the world, especially on the internet. I felt misinformation was spreading quickly, to the point where I couldn't determine which statistics were real and which weren't. 

So, I found a huge and global dataset on the COVID-19 pandemic that included information such as case numbers, vacccination rates, deaths, country population numbers and so much more. I then sought to analyze this data with MySQL to try to answer the questions I had about the pandemic, specifically what the statistics were in Canada.
